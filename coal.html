          Since 2001, U.S. energy companies have proposed more than 150 new coal
          plants. But a loose network of environmental activists, aided by
          uncertain economic conditions, has forced plans for more than 100 of
          the plants to be abandoned. Dozens more are clogged up in the court
          systems.
        </p>
        <p>
          One such coal fight is unfolding in Meigs County, Ohio, which is
          already surrounded by four coal-fired power plants. American Municipal
          Power has proposed building a new Meigs County coal plant, slated to
          begin construction late this year or in early 2010.
        </p>
        <p>
          The following information provides background to explain why coal
          plants are at the center of a national debate over energy production
          and consumption.
        </p>
        <h2>What's the connection between coal and electricity?</h2>
        <p>
          Nearly 50 percent of U.S. electricity comes from coal. Coal-fired
          power plants burn coal to generate steam, which is used to turn the
          turbines of an electrical generator.
        </p>
        <p>
          The U.S. has one of the largest coal reserves in the world and burns
          it at about 600 plants across the nation. Generating electricity from
          coal is common in the South and in the heartland, but less often used
          in regions such as the West Coast, where hydroelectricity and natural
          gas are bigger sources of power.
        </p>
        <h2>
          If coal is so important to electricity generation, why are some people
          concerned about building new coal-fired power plants?
